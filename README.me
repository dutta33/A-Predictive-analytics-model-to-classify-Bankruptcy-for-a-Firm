The objective of the project was to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures to foresee a financial condition (Bankruptcy or not) of a firm based on a financial balance sheet data set available on Kaggle.
We used multiple algorithms to apply Logistic regression and found out that the XGBOOST Gradient boosting algorithm gave the best results leading to the most accurate classification of a firms financial health.
